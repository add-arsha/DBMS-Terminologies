    <div class="term">
        <h2>1. Data</h2>
        <p>In Database Management Systems (DBMS), data constitutes the foundational elements that are stored, organized, and managed within the system. Data in DBMS refers to raw facts, figures, or symbols that represent information. It can take various forms, including numbers, text, images, and multimedia. The significance of data lies in its organization into structured formats like tables, where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes or fields). DBMS ensures data integrity by enforcing constraints and rules that maintain accuracy, consistency, and validity throughout the data lifecycle. Data in DBMS serves multiple functions, such as efficient storage to optimize space utilization, retrieval through query languages for extracting specific information, and manipulation through operations like insertion, updating, and deletion. This structured approach to handling data facilitates effective data management, analysis, and decision-making within organizations.</p>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>2. Information</h2>
        <p>In DBMS, information is the processed and meaningful output derived from raw data through organization, interpretation, and contextualization. It goes beyond mere data points by providing insights, trends, or summaries that support decision-making and understanding of complex relationships within the data. For example, in a sales database, raw transaction data becomes information when analyzed to show sales trends by region or product category, enabling businesses to adjust strategies or forecast future sales accurately.</p>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>3. Metadata</h2>
        <p>Metadata encompasses descriptive information about data within a DBMS, including its structure, format, and context. It serves as a crucial layer of data management, providing details about data origins, definitions, relationships, and usage. Metadata aids in data governance by ensuring data consistency, facilitating data integration across different systems, and enhancing data discovery and understanding for users and applications.</p>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>4. Data Dictionary</h2>
        <p>A Data Dictionary in DBMS acts as a comprehensive catalog of data elements used within a database system. It includes detailed descriptions of each data element, such as its name, definition, data type, length, and constraints. This repository helps in standardizing data definitions across the organization, ensuring data integrity, and providing a clear reference for database administrators, developers, and users to understand the structure and usage of data entities within the database.</p>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>5. Database</h2>
        <p>In DBMS, a Database is a structured collection of data organized and stored electronically. It serves as a centralized repository for storing, managing, and manipulating data, supporting various applications and user interactions. Databases can be relational, hierarchical, network-oriented, or object-oriented, each with its advantages depending on the specific needs of the application and data management requirements.</p>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>6. Table</h2>
        <p>A Table in DBMS organizes data into rows (records) and columns (fields or attributes), forming a fundamental structure for storing and managing data in a relational database. Each row represents a unique data record, while columns define specific data attributes or properties. Tables enable efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and storage, supporting relational operations such as querying data using SQL (Structured Query Language) and establishing relationships between different data entities within the database schema.</p>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>7. Tuple(s)</h2>
        <p>A Tuple in DBMS refers to a single row or record within a table that contains a specific set of data values corresponding to each column defined in the table schema. Tuples represent individual instances or entries of data within the database. In relational databases, tuples are unique and identified by their primary keys, which ensure data uniqueness and integrity across the database. Tuples are essential for representing and storing discrete units of data, supporting relational operations and data manipulation tasks within DBMS.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>8. Field(s)</h2>
        <p>A Field in DBMS refers to a single data element or attribute within a record or tuple in a database table. It represents a specific characteristic or property of the entity described by the table. Each field has a defined data type (such as integer, string, date) and may have associated constraints (such as size limits, allowed values, or data validation rules) to ensure data integrity and consistency. Fields organize and categorize data within tables, enabling structured data storage, efficient data retrieval, and meaningful data analysis.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>9. Domain(s)</h2>
        <p>A Domain in DBMS specifies the allowable values for a field or attribute within a database table. It defines the data type, format, and range of valid values that a field can contain. Domains ensure data validity and integrity by enforcing constraints on allowable data values, preventing incorrect or inconsistent data entries. By defining and managing data domains, DBMS ensures that data stored in tables adheres to predefined rules and standards, facilitating data quality and consistency across the database system.</p>
        <div class="figure">

    </div>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>10. Constraint(s)</h2>
        <p>Constraints in DBMS are rules or conditions that govern the type and quality of data that can be stored in database tables. They ensure data integrity by enforcing business rules and maintaining consistency within the database. Common types of constraints include unique constraints, which ensure that values in a column or set of columns are unique across the table; check constraints, which validate data against specified conditions (e.g., range of values, format); and foreign key constraints, which establish relationships between tables by referencing primary keys in related tables.</p>
        <div class="figure">

    </div>

    <div class="term">
        <h2>11. Key(s)</h2>
        <p>Keys in DBMS are attributes or combinations of attributes that uniquely identify records within database tables. They play a crucial role in data management by facilitating data retrieval, maintaining data integrity, and supporting relational operations. The primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring data uniqueness and acting as a reference point for establishing relationships with other tables. Foreign keys, on the other hand, establish relationships between tables by referencing primary keys in related tables, enforcing referential integrity and supporting data consistency across the database. Keys are essential for data normalization, efficient querying, and ensuring accurate data retrieval and manipulation within DBMS environments.</p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Database Management Systems (DBMS) play a critical role in modern information technology by providing a structured approach to storing, managing, and retrieving data. They offer several advantages such as improved data sharing, enhanced security, and efficient data integration. However, they also present challenges including complexity in design and maintenance costs. Despite these drawbacks, DBMS remains indispensable for organizations seeking reliable data management solutions that support decision-making, data integrity, and operational efficiency across various applications and industries.</p>
